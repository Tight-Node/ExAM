# Simple Angular with Firebase project.

This project was written with **Angular** and **Firebase**, designed to run well in apache server. There is nothing to install
is just clone it and run! Every code was made respecting **SOLID**, **DRY** and **KISS** principles, as well as **TDD**
and **BDD** approach.

There is no other language then **JS** in this project, no one line of PHP or other language, the backend
was completely designed with **JS**, both routes and persistence was designed with **JS**, using to the max
the Angular resources.

It was built with responsive design and there is many **HTML5** tags as well as **Canvas** and **animations**,
so it is important to use a modern browser with **HTML5** support to watch it working correctly.
I use **localStorage** as well as **sessionStorage** **JS** API to manipulate temporary data and Firebase to
persist permanent data.

Many **JS** frameworks with **Node.js**, was used to built this project, so if you want to modify
the code it would be interesting install them. I let the package.json, so it is just run: ```npm install```.

The **HTML5** and **CSS3** code was compiled, I originally written them with **Jade** and **SASS** (less writing!)
and use **Gulp** and **Watch** to keep them updated and compiled. The **JS** code was concatenated and uglyfied
using the **Concat** and **Uglify** npm frameworks/modules. But you can find the original **JS** code in the
public/js folder.

I let the bower folder in the project, so is not necessary to install them, unless you want
to update the libs.

I use the following frameworks to build this project:

- Gulp
- Jade
- SASS
- Concat
- Uglify
- Jasmine
- Jsdoc
- Karma
- Bower
- Watch
and more..

**Gulp** and **Watch** will  and keep **Jade** and **SASS** files compiled.
